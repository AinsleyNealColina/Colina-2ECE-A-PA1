# Colina-2ECE-A-PA1

This assignment features three Python functions
# *alphabet_soup(word) which alphabetically sorts characters in a word 
# *emotify(sentence) which replaces emotion-related words with emoticons using a predefined dictionary 
# *arrange_numbers(numbers) which separates a list of integers into first, middle, and last elements
all wrapped in interactive loops that prompt user input, validate entries, and display transformed outputs, offering a simple yet effective demonstration of string manipulation, dictionary mapping, and list unpacking, ideal for beginners exploring core programming concepts like conditionals, loops, and data structures in Python through hands-on practice and real-time feedback in a command-line interface.
